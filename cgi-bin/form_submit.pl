##read form data
my $firstname = param('fname');

##param function/routine gives the value of the form field
##whose name is passed as a parameter

## a new variable is declared as my $variablename;
## later that variable may by called by just using $variablename (without the "my")

##Define SQL Vars

##Build Connection String and connect
my $dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $userid, $password ) or die $DBI::errstr;

##Execute SQL
my $sth = $dbh->prepare("INSERT INTO contact_info_new
                       (first_name, last_name, email, phone )
                        values
                       (?,?,?,?)");
$sth->execute($firstname,$lastname,$email,$phone_num) 
          or die $DBI::errstr;
$sth->finish();
$dbh->disconnect();

##Connect to DB and extract # of entries
my $dbh = DBI->connect($dsn, $userid, $password ) or die $DBI::errstr;
my $sth = $dbh->prepare("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM contact_info_new");
$sth->execute() or die $DBI::errstr;
my $user_count=$sth->fetchrow_array();

$sth->finish();
$dbh->disconnect();

##Display
print "Thank you, ",$firstname,", for the form submission. Your submission # is ";#$user_count"!";
