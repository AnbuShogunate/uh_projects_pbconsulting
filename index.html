					<h2>BRIEF SUMMARY</h2>

					<p>My name is Egor Shumeyko. I was born in Russia, came to the States when I was 14, and lived here ever since.
					I lived in Florida for a while before moving to Texas. I currently work as a Systems Administrator for a small Oil & Gas company and
					I like to dabble in all things IT. So far I have experience with WebHosting and Web Design,
					Windows and Linux server administration and setup, VM machines, WebApps, and so much more...</p>
					<p>This site is built for a class project. The class is CIS2336 - Internet Application Development taught by Kamil Khanipov.
						I will use this site to showcase multiple web languages and technologies before the semester is over. This site will also server as a final project.</p>
					<p>I am deviating from some instructions for the purposes of creating a cleaner look for my Site.  </p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p>I am going to try and make this site as responsive as possible for mobile viewing. If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, don't hesitate to shoot me an email.</p>
