Question Answers:
  1. HTML is a mark up language that structures the web page and orginizes the information on screen into presentable blocks.
  2. CSS is a sort of addon to HTML that stylizes the content presented by HTML and gives the ability to customize the appearance of any piece of the site.
  3. SQL is both a database that stores data for the webpage to display and the language that is used to set /get / update / delete data within the database.
  4. Javascript is an additional layer to HTML/CSS stack that allows manipulation of the page content without reloading the page.
